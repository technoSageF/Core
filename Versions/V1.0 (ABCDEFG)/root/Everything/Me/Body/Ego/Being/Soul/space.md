In the context of ego, 'space' refers to the psychological and emotional environment that an individual occupies or experiences internally. It encompasses the mental and emotional boundaries that define personal identity and the extent of self. This space includes areas of personal freedom, privacy, and the capacity for personal growth and reflection. It's where personal beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and experiences are processed and stored, contributing to the sense of self and personal boundaries.
