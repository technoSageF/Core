[.] Religion is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses beliefs, practices, moral codes, and worldviews that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. It often involves the worship of a deity or deities, the adherence to a set of rituals and guidelines, and the participation in a community of believers. Religions can provide a sense of purpose, direction, and meaning to life, as well as a framework for understanding the universe and one's place within it.
