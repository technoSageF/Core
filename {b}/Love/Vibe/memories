Hello, World!

[.] Memories are the mental records of our experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. They are a fundamental aspect of human cognition, enabling us to retain information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. Memories can be short-term, lasting only a few moments, or long-term, lasting from minutes to a lifetime. They play a crucial role in learning, decision-making, and forming our identities and sense of self.
