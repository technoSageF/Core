[.] Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. It encompasses a vast range of disciplines, each dedicated to understanding various aspects of the natural world and the laws that govern it. At its core, science is driven by empirical evidenceâ€”observations and experiments that are carefully designed to be repeatable and verifiable by others. This methodical approach allows scientists to refine, reject, or confirm theories and models, contributing to an ever-expanding body of knowledge.
